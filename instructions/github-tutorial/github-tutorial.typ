= A tutorial onion to use GitHub Desktop
\
Note: This is not the `optimal` way of using git ot github, but it simplifies the process a lot. In an ideal condition you will use your IDE instead of this App which may be VScode or any other Development Envioronment you use.
\

== Make a github account first by going to `github.com` or from the App itself.
== Open the Github Desktop App and Sign In.

#pagebreak()

= Click on create a new repository on your local drive.
== This is where the things you track are put on your computer.
=== (I recommend learning about the app by creating a tutorial repository.)

#image("Screenshot From 2025-06-30 08-21-57.png", width: 100%)
#pagebreak()

= Fill in the details and initialize the repository with a README.
== You dont need to put anything on `gitignore` and `license` for now.
== Then, on the next screen, click on publish repository.
#image("Screenshot From 2025-06-30 08-22-52.png", width: 100%)
#pagebreak()

= Uncheck the `Keep this code private` checkbox before publishing the repository.
#image("Screenshot From 2025-06-30 08-23-40.png", width: 100%)
#pagebreak()

= You will see, "No Local Changes"
== To add your PDF you created, click on "Show in your File Manager" button.
#image("Screenshot From 2025-06-30 08-23-59.png", width: 100%)
#pagebreak()

= Your file manager pops up with the README.md.
== This is where you put the files you want to track.
== Put the PDF you created in this folder.
== Everything you put in this folder will be uploaded to github publicly so don't put anything like your Password lsit or Keys in this folder.
#image("Screenshot From 2025-06-30 08-24-20.png", width: 100%)
#pagebreak()

= I have put my PDF in the folder.
#image("Screenshot From 2025-06-30 08-27-06.png", width: 100%)
#pagebreak()

= Now, in the github app, I can see that it shows my PDF as a binary file.
== On the left side panel, everything(The PDF file) is ticked
== You can see two text-boxes on the bottom-left where you write your commit messages.

Commit messages are the messages you write when you change something in the thing you are tracking. So, write what you changed there.

== The small box should have the short summarized version of what you changed.
== The bigger box should have the detailed description of things you have changed.

#image("Screenshot From 2025-06-30 08-27-20.png", width: 100%)
#pagebreak()

= Here I have updated the text-boxes with the commit messages.
== Then click "Commit to Main"
`Main` is the name of the branch you are working on. When you commit you are saying the software that what you changed is something you want to save in case (It is in the working condition) you want to revert it back to this version. It is a snapshot of that file.

== This pushes the things you just commited to github. And you can now access the files from the GitHub `github.com` website.

== For me it is on `https://github.com/scientiac/technomorph`
= This is the Link you need to put on the submission form.
